<!-- Math 1
Let's start out by testing your knowledge of basic math operators. You will create four numeric values, add two together, subtract one from another, then multiply the results. Finally, we need to write a check that proves that this value is an even number.

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example by following these steps:

Create four variables that contain numbers. Call the variables something sensible.
Add the first two variables together and store the result in another variable.
Subtract the fourth variable from the third and store the result in another variable.
Multiply the results from steps 2 and 3 and store the result in a variable called finalResult.
Check if finalResult is an even number using an arithmetic operator and store the result in a variable called evenOddResult.
To pass this test, finalResult should have a value of 48 and evenOddResult should have a value of 0. -->
